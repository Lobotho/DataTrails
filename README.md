Hi there!

This project is part of my process to develop my data analyst skills by learning new tools and ways to do things. 
It's not intended to be a real study although it can be a starting point to collect weather data.

### How to run the notebook
If you want to download and run the project, you should add the "json" folder in your google drive root or change the variable  `directory_path`.

That folder contains the .json files scrapped from the WUnderground web. You can find more info on how I did that on the notebook.

Thanks!
