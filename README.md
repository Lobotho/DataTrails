Hi there!

This project is part of my process to develop my data analyst skills by learning new tools and ways to do things. 
It's not intended to be a real study although it can be a starting point to collect weather data.

Having said that, the notebook was created using Google Colab and the "json" folder should be placed at the MyDrive root: "/content/drive/MyDrive/json".

That folder contains the .json files scrapped from the WUnderground web. You can find more info on how I did that on the notebook.

Thanks!
